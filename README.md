# Ghost Writer Project swe7d

## Run
### Development
While developing, we want to take advantage of React's hot reloading. To do this we will start a react server and an express server. 

1. In the root of the project, run `npm start` to start the express server
2. cd into `client` and run `npm start` to start the react server. It will be available on `http://localhost:9000`
3. To see the react development server, open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
